== Context

Every time your credit or debit card initiates a transaction, the underlying payment system validates the transaction with a series of checks. Some checks are simple, such as making sure that you have enough funds. Other checks are more advanced, such as filtering the history of card payments to identify a personalized pattern and validating the given transaction against that pattern.

In this tutorial, you'll build an application that validates transactions made at airports, using the following process:

. Compare the time between two transactions. Transaction A is the previous transaction and transaction B is the current transaction.
. Calculate the distance between the airports where the transactions were made, using the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula[haversine formula].
. Determine whether someone could move from one airport to the other within the given timeframe.

For example, if transaction A is made in London and transaction B is made in Frankfurt, and the time between them is greater than two hours, then the transaction is *valid*.

image:serverless-fraud-detection:transaction-valid.png[A valid transaction made in Frankfurt airport]

If transaction A is made in London and transaction B is made in New York, and the time between them is less than two hours, then the transaction is *suspicious*.

image:serverless-fraud-detection:transaction-declined.png[An invalid transaction made in New York airport]

Every time a new transaction is made, the airport's coordinates are read and used as input in the haversine formula. If the data is slow to read, the whole process takes longer, which delays the transaction. To make sure that this data is always available and fast to read, it is cached in a {hazelcast-cloud} Standard cluster because it offers fast-access in-memory storage.

=== Architecture

The whole stack is in the same AWS region to ensure the shortest network paths between the components.

image:serverless-fraud-detection:architecture.png[A banking client sends a POST request to the serverless fraud detection application]

- The S3 bucket stores the airport data.

- The `ImportAirportsFn` Lambda function ingests the airport data into the {hazelcast-cloud} Standard cluster so that it can be queried with the lowest latency. This function is triggered by uploads to the S3 bucket so that any new data is ingested to the {hazelcast-cloud} Standard cluster.

- The `ValidateFn` Lambda function implements the fraud detection logic to validate the transactions. This function communicates with the {hazelcast-cloud} Standard cluster to read airport data.

- The Amazon API Gateway exposes the `ValidateFn` Lambda function to a REST API resource at the `/validate` path.

- The {hazelcast-cloud} Standard cluster stores a copy of the airport data so that the `ValidateFn` Lambda function can read it faster than if it were in the S3 bucket.

== Before you Begin

You need the following:

- A command-line tool such as Terminal for macOS.
- Knowledge of AWS services, in particular link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html[IAM roles], link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html[S3], and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html[Lambda].
- An link:https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/[AWS account]
- link:https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm[npm]
- The link:https://httpie.io/cli[HTTPie CLI]
- A xref:cloud:ROOT:create-serverless-cluster.adoc[{hazelcast-cloud} Standard cluster].
+
NOTE: This tutorial assumes that your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster is hosted in the us-west-2 (Oregon) region. For best performance, it's important to host the AWS services in a region that's closest to your cluster. If you choose to host your Serverless cluster in a different region, edit the `--region` flag of the AWS CLI commands in this tutorial.


== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Set Up the Project Files

To set up the project, you need to download the code from GitHub, install the dependencies, and get the TLS certificate files to allow the Hazelcast client to connect to your {hazelcast-cloud} Standard cluster.

. Clone the GitHub repository.
+
[tabs] 
====
HTTPS:: 
+ 
--
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/serverless-fraud-detection.git
cd serverless-fraud-detection/code
```
--
SSH:: 
+ 
--
```bash
git clone git@github.com:hazelcast-guides/serverless-fraud-detection.git
cd serverless-fraud-detection/code
```
--
====

. Install the project's dependencies.
+
```
npm i
```

. Open the {hazelcast-cloud} console. Next to *Connect Client*, select *Advanced* and download the keystore files using the *Download keystore file* link.

. Save your files to the `code/` directory.

== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Set Up the AWS CLI

You need the AWS CLI to complete this tutorial. To use the AWS CLI to connect to your AWS account and interact with services, you need to grant it the right permissions, using the IAM service. 

. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html[Install the AWS CLI].

. Open the IAM service in the AWS console.

. Go to *Policies* and click *Create policy*.

. Click the *JSON* tab and paste the following into the input box:
+
[source,json]
----
include::tutorials:serverless-fraud-detection:example$aws/cli_policy.json[]
----

. Click through the steps, and then give your policy a name, such as CLI.

. Go to *Users* and click *Add users*.

. Create a user with programmatic access and attach the policy that you just created to it.

. Copy the *Access key id* and *Secret access key* credentials somewhere safe to use in the next step.

. Configure the CLI with your access key credentials.
+
[tabs] 
====
Linux and macOS:: 
+ 
--
Open the `~/.aws/credentials` file and paste the following. Add the values for your access key id and secret access key:

```bash
[default]
aws_access_key_id=
aws_secret_access_key=
```
--
Windows:: 
+ 
--
Open the `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials` file and paste the following. Add the values for your access key id and secret access key:

```bash
[default]
aws_access_key_id=
aws_secret_access_key=
```
--
====

== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Set Up the S3 Bucket and IAM Roles

You need an S3 bucket and an IAM role that you can attach to the Lambda function later in this tutorial. The S3 bucket will store the airport data. The IAM role will grant the Lambda functions permission to upload logs to CloudWatch and read airport data from your S3 bucket.

. Create an S3 bucket in which to store the airport data. Replace `$BUCKET_NAME` with a unique name for your bucket.
+
```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --region us-west-2 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2
```

. [[create-lambda-role]]Create an IAM role for your Lambda and API Gateway services. You'll create the API Gateway in the last step of this tutorial.
+
```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name HazelcastServerlessFraudDetection --assume-role-policy-document file://aws/lambda_trust_policy.json
```
+
.Example output

        "Path": "/",
        "RoleName": "HazelcastServerlessFraudDetection",
        "RoleId": "AROA4EAWH6IZ5HCD6OVIJ",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::833270313523:role/HazelcastServerlessFraudDetection",

                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"

                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
====

. Copy the ARN that is displayed in the output. You'll need the ARN later in this tutorial.

. Attach a policy to your role so that the Lambda functions have permission to upload logs and read airport data from your S3 bucket.
+
```bash
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name HazelcastServerlessFraudDetection --policy-name HazelcastLambda --policy-document file://aws/lambda_policy.json
```

[[ingest]]
== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Ingest Airport Data

The code that ingests airport data from the S3 bucket into your {hazelcast-cloud} Standard cluster uses the following resources in the `code/` directory:

- `hazelcast.js`: Creates a Hazelcast client to connect to the cluster.
- `import.js`: Ingests the airport data from the S3 bucket into the cluster where it can be read faster. This code uses the client in the `hazelcast.js` file to communicate with the cluster.
- `node_modules/`: Contains the project dependencies.
- `.pem` files: Contain the TLS certificate data to authenticate the Hazelcast client.

. Zip the files so that they are ready to be given to the Lambda function.
+
```bash
zip -r import.zip import.js hazelcast.js node_modules ca.pem cert.pem key.pem
```

. Create the Lambda function and pass it your zipped file. Replace the `$ROLE_ARN` placeholder with the ARN of the `HazelcastServerlessFraudDetection` role that you created when you <<create-lambda-role, set up the AWS services>>.
+
```bash
aws lambda create-function --function-name ImportAirportsFn --role $ROLE_ARN  --zip-file fileb://import.zip --handler import.handle --description "Imports Airport Data from S3 into the Hazelcast Viridian cluster" --runtime nodejs16.x --region us-west-2 --timeout 30 --memory-size 256 --publish

```
====

. Copy the value of the `FunctionArn` field and paste it into the `aws/s3_notification.json` file to replace the `$FUNCTION_ARN` placeholder.

. Grant the `ImportAirportsFn` function permission to be invoked whenever data is uploaded to the S3 bucket. Replace the `$S3_BUCKET_NAME` placeholder with the name of your S3 bucket.
+
```bash
aws lambda add-permission --function-name ImportAirportsFn --action lambda:InvokeFunction --principal s3.amazonaws.com --source-arn arn:aws:s3:::$S3_BUCKET_NAME --statement-id hazelcast-viridian-lambda-permission --region us-west-2

}
```
====

. Configure the s3 bucket to notify your `ImportAirportsFn` function whenever new data is added to the bucket. Replace the `$S3_BUCKET_NAME` placeholder with the name of the S3 bucket that you created.
+
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration --bucket $S3_BUCKET_NAME --notification-configuration file://aws/s3_notification.json --region us-west-2
```

. Open the {hazelcast-cloud} console. Next to *Connect Client*, select *Advanced* to view cluster token and certificate password. Leave this window open. You'll need some of these details in the next step.

. Configure the `ImportAirportsFn` function with the environment variables that the Hazelcast client needs to connect to your cluster.
+
```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name ImportAirportsFn --environment Variables="{CLUSTER_NAME=$CLUSTER_NAME,KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD,DISCOVERY_TOKEN=$DISCOVERY_TOKEN}" --region us-west-2

====

. Upload the airport data to the S3 bucket.
+
```bash
aws s3 cp data/airports.json s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/
```
+
.Example output
[%collapsible]
====
```
upload: data/airports.json to s3://hazelcast-airports/airports.json
```
====

. Open the CloudWatch service, go to *Logs* > *Log groups*, and find the logs for the */aws/lambda/ImportAirportsFn* group.
+
image:serverless-fraud-detection:cloudwatch-connected.png[The logs show that the client connected to the cluster]
+
The logs show that the Lambda function was invoked when the airport data was uploaded.

. Open the {hazelcast-cloud} console and go to *Management Center* > *SQL Browser*.
+
You can see that the Lambda function ingested the airport data into Hazelcast, using the following SQL queries:
+
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MAPPING airports
TYPE IMAP
OPTIONS (
  'keyFormat'='varchar',
  'valueFormat'='json'
);
```
+
```sql
SELECT * FROM airports;
```

The airport data is stored in a map called `airports`.

image:serverless-fraud-detection:airports-sql-browser.png[Airport data is displayed in the results of the SQL query]

== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Validate Transactions Against the Airport Data

The code that validates incoming transactions against the airport data in your cluster uses the following resources in the `code/` directory:

- `hazelcast.js`: Creates a Hazelcast client to connect to the cluster.
- `validate.js`: Reads the airport data in the cluster to determine whether a transaction is valid. This code uses the client in the `hazelcast.js` file to communicate with the cluster.
- `node_modules/`: Contains the project dependencies.
- `.pem` files: Contain the TLS certificate data to authenticate the Hazelcast client.

. Zip the files so that they are ready to be given to the Lambda function.
+
```bash
zip -r validate.zip validate.js hazelcast.js node_modules ca.pem cert.pem key.pem
```

. Create the function. Replace the `$ROLE_ARN` placeholder with the ARN of the `HazelcastServerlessFraudDetection` role that you created when you <<create-lambda-role, set up the AWS services>>. Also, configure the `$CLUSTER_NAME`, `$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, and `$DISCOVERY_TOKEN` variables like you did for the other Lambda function.
+
```bash
aws lambda create-function --function-name ValidateFn --role $ROLE_ARN --zip-file fileb://validate.zip --handler validate.handle --description "Validates User Transactions" --runtime nodejs16.x --environment Variables="{CLUSTER_NAME=$CLUSTER_NAME,KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD,DISCOVERY_TOKEN=$DISCOVERY_TOKEN}" --region us-west-2 --timeout 30 --memory-size 256 --publish

    }
}
```
====

. In the AWS console, open the Lambda service and click *Functions* > *ValidateFn* > *Test*.

. In the input box, enter the following JSON data to simulate a transaction event, and click *Test*.
+
image:serverless-fraud-detection:test-event.png[The Test button is in the top-right of the page]
+
```json
{
  "userId": 1234,
  "airportCode": "FRA",
  "transactionTimestamp": "2022-08-15T17:52:40Z"
}
```
+
.Example output
[%collapsible]
====
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "message": "Transaction performed from the same location"
}
```
====

Because this is the first recorded transaction, it is valid. The API now thinks that you are in France.

== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Create the API Gateway Endpoint

To allow applications to validate new transactions, you need to expose the `ValidateFn` function. AWS has a service called API Gateway that allows you to expose your Lambda functions to a public REST API.

. Open the API Gateway service in the AWS console.

. Click *Build* in the *REST API* section.

. Create a new REST API called *ServerlessFraudDetectionGateway*.
+
image:serverless-fraud-detection:new-api.png[Form for creating a new API]

. Create a new resource:

- *Resource Name*: `ValidateTransactions` 
- *Resource Path*: `/`

. Create a POST method for the */ValidateTransactions* resource:

- *Lambda Function*: `ValidateFn`
+
image:serverless-fraud-detection:validate-resource.png[The resource is configured to trigger the ValidateFn function]

. Go to *Models* > *Create* and enter the following:

- *Model name*: `ValidateRequestModel`
- *Content type*: `application/json`
- *Model schema*:
+
[source,json]
----
include::tutorials:serverless-fraud-detection:example$aws/model.json[]
----

. Go to *Resources* > */validate* > *Actions* > *Deploy API* and enter the following to deploy your API Gateway:

- *Deployment stage*: [New Stage]
- *Stage name*: Test

. Copy the *Invoke URL* at the top of the page.

. Use your new `/validate` resource to send some data to the `ValidateFn` function. Replace the `$INVOKE_URL` placeholder with your invoke URL.
+
.Valid transaction
```bash
http POST $INVOKE_URL/validate userId:=12345 airportCode=FRA transactionTimestamp=2019-03-18T17:55:40Z
