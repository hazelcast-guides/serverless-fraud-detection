= Serverless Fraud Detection
:experimental: true

This is an example of how to use a Viridian Serverless cluster as a fast cache for static data that is used by an AWS Lambda function to contextualize transactions and detect fraud.

TIP: For step-by-step instructions of how to run this app, see the link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/tutorials/serverless-fraud-detection[tutorial].

== Internal Hazelcast Developers

If you want to try this tutorial in the UAT or DEV environment, edit the `hazelcast.js` file to include the following settings:

```js
let createClientConfig = () => {
    return {
        network: {
            ...
            },
            ssl: {
                ...
                sslOptions: {
                    ...
                    // Otherwise the client will throw an error 
                    // because the cluster's hostname doesn't match the one 
                    // in the TLS certificate.
                    checkServerIdentity: () => null
                }
            }
        },
        properties: {
            // For DEV, use https://test.dev.hazelcast.cloud
            'hazelcast.client.cloud.url': 'https://uat.hazelcast.cloud',
            ...
        }
    }
};
```
